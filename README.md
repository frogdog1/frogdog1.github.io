     Course Description:
     
     The goal of this class is to explore the nature of beauty in our lives, our environments, and the world at large. Through the examination of art, philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and linguistics, we will discuss the vastness of meaning tied to love, beauty, morality, and culture, and determine threads of connectivity between these things. We will offer multiple perspectives on many topics, and hopefully, very hopefully, the student in this course will exit with nuanced addition to their perspective on life. This class caters to individuals with inclinations towards the cross-disciplinary, an openness to strangeness, and an appreciation for their fellow traveler. Applications are required due to limited seats. 2 units are offered in a P/NP setting.
     
     
     Pedagogical Methodology; Fun, Experience, Trying:
     
     
     This class will be discussion based; there will be guided lectures with emphasis on class participation, but content will largely be explicated through open discussion. Readings/viewings/listenings will be given weekly, and short assignments will be given to support topic comprehension and application. This class will be of small size, so as to promote openness and friendship. In essence, we hope that we can become friends, as intellectual discussion between friends can often be the purest and most revelatory! There will be writing involved in the coursework, as well as a project asking for artistic creation. Depending on the backgrounds of enrolled students, the course will be adjusted to accommodate more or less technical rigor(concerning mainly mathematics, linguistics and computer science), but overall we do not wish to overwhelm students with technical material, and most(if not all) topics will be discussed from a solely conceptual (and non-technical) basis.
     
     
     Prerequisites (non-mandatory):
     At least one upper division course in at least one of the following subjects:
     Computer Science/Data Science, Rhetoric, Philosophy, Literature, Linguistics, Mathematics, Cognitive Science, Music, Art (of any discipline).
     and/or: a background/extracurricular interest in one or more of these subjects
     If these prerequisites do not apply to you, please apply anyways! Applications will NOT be scrutinized based on academic backgrounds/skills; we just want to get to know you a little.    
     
     Grading and Point Distribution:
     
     Assignments will be graded holistically, and by an engagement based metric. This means: if you try, you will get really good grades on everything. If you show up to class and participate in discussions, you will get really good grades on everything. At the end of the day, this class is only worthwhile for people who truly care about learning things and thinking about them. If this describes you, it is very likely that you will, again, get really good grades on everything. We want you to want to be here. Grades will be distributed as follows: 
     
     Attendance/discussion participation:  50%
     Course Essay:                         10%
     Artistic Offering:                    10%
     Final:                                20%
     Weekly Assignments:                   10%
     
     Assignments:
     
     Other than the Course Essay, Art Project, and Final, there are two types of assignments which occur in this class:
     
     Language-Games
     Inspired by Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations, language-game assignments in this class are given to allow students to apply concepts learned during each unit of the course, through the medium of language. These assignments usually take the form of short written pieces or linguistic exercises, and require a submission on BCourses or on paper. Language-games are graded by the sole metric of completion.
     
     
     
     Intangibles
     Intangible assignments include activities which do not pertain specifically to the course material, and do not entail any submissions or proof of completion. Intangibles are often abstract or humorous editions of lightheartedness. You will be able to tell if an assignment is intangible if it does not include a prompt for submission. *INTANGIBLE ASSIGNMENTS ARE OPTIONAL WITHOUT EXCEPTION* 
     
     
     
     
     *Extra Credit Policy*
     
     Necessities/non-perishable food donations, community service, or activism will translate to generous extra credit in this class. This will be honor based—meaning you do not need to offer proof of these things, but don’t lie about stuff like this—it’s not very cool. 
     
     Submissions:
     
     Assignments will be submitted through the class BCourses page, other than the final exam. Art submissions can—with student permission—be published in a course journal, which will be curated throughout/after the semester. There will also be flexibility for musical performances/film screenings if applicable.
     
     Readings:
     
     *Readings and viewings will be either free online, or provided by the facilitators. A subscription to a music streaming platform may be helpful, but musical materials will hopefully be available for free somewhere online. If this is not the case, we will integrate relevant listenings into the lecture.
     
     
     Accommodations:
     
     We are committed to accommodating students with disabilities, strenuous external circumstances, and any other challenges that may arise throughout the course of the semester. We do not want to negatively impact the mental health of our students, and are always available to discuss problems regarding assignments, attendance, or anything else related to the class. Please feel free to reach out to us if anything comes up! We are here to help.
